Created for a JustIT hackathon, 28th July - 1st August 2025.

### Tech stack

The frontend of this application uses Vite + React + Typescript.

Note: you will need to run the backend too for the app to work.

### To run the app
- run the backend application
- change the `.env.TEMPLATE` file to `.env`
- in `.env`, replace the `VITE_LOCAL_API_URL` with 'http://localhost:8080/api', ensuring the port number matches the port your backend app is running on
- run `npm install`
- run `nvm use node`
- run `npm run dev`
